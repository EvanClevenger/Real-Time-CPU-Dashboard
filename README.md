# **Real-Time CPU Dashboard**

This project is a real-time **CPU usage monitoring dashboard** that utilizes a client-server architecture. The server collects real-time CPU usage statistics and transmits the data to the client via WebSocket. The client visualizes the data in an interactive line chart, making it easy to track CPU performance over time.

## **Features**

- **Real-time CPU usage monitoring.**
- **Interactive line chart visualization using Recharts.**
- **WebSocket communication with Socket.IO for seamless data streaming.**
- **Timestamps** for each CPU usage data point, displayed in _hours and minutes_.

## **Technologies Used**

Hereâ€™s a list of technologies and libraries used in this project:

### **Backend:**

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server.
- **http (built-in)**: Creates the server to handle requests.
- **os-utils**: Retrieves system-level CPU usage statistics.
- **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and client.

### **Frontend:**

- **React**: Library for building the user interface.
- **Recharts**: Library for creating data visualizations such as line charts.
- **Socket.IO Client**: Establishes WebSocket communication with the server.
